# python-excercise

This repo contains unit tests for a Python rehearsal exercise.

The exercise is intended to freshen up your Python skills, particularly in case you've learned Python in the past but are feeling a bit rusty. 

The exercise instructions can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/urig/python-exercise/wiki).
